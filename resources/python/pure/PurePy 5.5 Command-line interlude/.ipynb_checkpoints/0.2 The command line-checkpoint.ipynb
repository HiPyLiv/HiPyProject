    "# A very short introduction introduction to command-line computing\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is not about Python. But it is worth the time of any new Python programmer, or anyone who uses computers a lot. We have to have a discussion about the command-line. Most of us in the modern era have grown up using a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with our computers. This is where we use a mouse or touch screen to press on-screen buttons, drag-and-drop files, highlight text, move a scroll bar, or bring up a menu. But there is another method, in which we interact with the computer by typing in text commands, and getting text output. For many, this is an ancient relic seen only in films such as <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>War Games</i>, or <i>Hackers</i>, but in the world of computers and computer programming, it remains an invaluable tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the command-line isn't pretty, and takes a little practice to learn. Most commercial software is no longer written for the command-line for this reason. But as Python beginners, we're generally going to be writing programs that:\n",
    "1. Takes some input,\n",
    "2. Performs some task or computation,\n",
    "3. Gives some output,\n",
    "\n",
    "rather than writing commercial software. For this purpose, a text-based, command-line is quicker, easier, and just as effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to learn basic command-line skills:\n",
    "- Command-line software is easier to write than graphical software.\n",
    "- Many tasks easier and faster with the command-line.\n",
    "- Access to vast repositories of free command-line software.\n",
    "- More freedom to tinker with the workings of your computer.\n",
    "- Feel like a hacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there are still many tasks which lend themselves better to the graphical interface. I don't know many people, for instance, who manage their emails from the command-line (though such masochists do exist). It's just about choosing the correct tool for the job."

    "Before we begin, three basic terms. A <i>command-line</i> is any computer interface in which you type text commands rather than click buttons to make things happen. A <i>terminal</i> or <i>terminal emulator</i> is a piece of software on your computer that displays the text for a command-line interface. Finally, a <i>shell</i> is the software \"behind the scenes\", that interprets your commands, performs the tasks you ask of it, and then displays the result in your terminal. These words are sometimes used somewhat interchangeably. Something like \"type this command into the command-line\", \"type this command into the terminal\", \"type this command into the shell\" all mean basically the same thing."

    "## Accessing a command-line\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise software you use will depend on your operating system. If it is at all possible, you should try to use the Bash shell. This has become the standard shell across Mac OSX and Linux operating systems. It is now also available as an experimental feature of Windows 10: see [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) for installation instructions. If you are on Windows, but either you do not have Windows 10 or you do not want to install Bash for some reason, then you can use a software that comes with Windows call Powershell. The most basic commands of Powershell and Bash are roughly the same, and most of the things we learn in this tutorial are applicable to Bash and Powershell.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On Windows, either follow the Bash instructions above, or go to the Start Menu, type Powershell, and open the software it suggests. Note that in Powershell you might have to use backslashes instead of slashes for file paths.\n",
    "* On OSX, press <code>cmd+space</code>. This will open the spotlight, which can access any file or program on your computer. Type Terminal, and you will shown the correct software on the menu. Consider adding the terminal to your dock, as it is very useful to have quick access.\n",
    "* On Linux systems, go to whatever interface you usually use to open software. If you're on Ubuntu or GNOME or something, try the gnome-terminal, usually accessible just be typing \"Terminal\". If you are on another operating system, you might not have gnome-terminal, but you will definitely have xterm or some equivalent, so try searching for xterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now after allowing everything to load, you should see some kind of command-prompt. On Powershell, I think it will end with a > symbol. In Bash, it will probably be a <code>$</code> sign. This means the command-line is ready to take commands."

    "## Will I break my computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably not. There are several checks to make sure you do not do anything dangerous unwittingly. The command for deleting files requires special permissions to delete entire folders, for example. In Bash, many commands that involve installing software, changing important settings or modifying key system files will require you to log-in as an administrator or enter an administrator password before proceeding (even if you are already logged in as an administrator in your normal graphical session).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a command\n",
    "\n",
    "A command has the structure \"<code>command options arguments</code>\". The <code>command</code> is a program we'd like to run, or an action we'd like to take. For example, if I open my terminal and simply type <code>firefox</code>, then it opens my web browser. Many commands and programs run inside the terminal, unlike Firefox. Options are things we can add to change the way the command works, often beginning with a <code>-</code> or <code>--</code>, and then a letter or word (for example, it is common in Bash that to get help for using a program, you follow the name of the command with <code>--help</code> e.g <code>firefox --help</code> gives more information about how to use the firefox command). Finally, the arguments are inputs to a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a very simple Bash program called <code>cat</code> can be used to show the contents of a text file in the terminal window. If I just type <code>cat</code>, then the program waits for me to type some text for it to display. If I type <code>cat A_FILE_NAME</code>, then the contents of that file will be displayed: the file name is an argument, an input to the program. Finally, as an example of using it with an option, <code>cat --number A_FILE_NAME</code>. This will display the contents of a file with line numbers shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the picture below; the output of the command is not important (I'm just displaying the contents of a file).\n",
    "\n",
    "![cat](Selection_113.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can usually see what the options are for a program by running <code>PROGRAM_NAME --help</code> or running <code>man PROGRAM_NAME</code>, that is, the program \"manuals\" with the name of the program you want help with as an argument."

If the target is not a directory, then the source file is renamed to whatever you set target to. For example, if I have a file called <code>my-file</code> in the home folder, and I wish to move it to Documents, I just type <code>mv my-file Documents</code>. If I want to renamed the file to, say, \"my-file2\", I type. <code>mv my-file my-file2</code>.\n",
