    "## While-loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The other kind of loop we have at our disposal is called a while-loop. Instead of doing something a fixed number of times, the while-loop executes its contents until some condition is met. This makes them work a lot like if statements, since we are checking whether a certain logical expression evaluates to True, or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "While-loops come with a word of warning. Prudence is required when programming the loop. If the condition is never met, then the program may continue to execute forever, until it is halted by outside forces, such as an interrupt message from the keyboard (usually ctrl+c), or the computer freezes because the computations it is performing have got out of hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a familiar real-world example, a computer game is nothing but a while-loop. The loop consists of\n",
    "* getting input from the player via the keyboard or joypad,\n",
    "* updating the game state, \n",
    "* drawing the results on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop is repeated possibly hundreds of times per second in the case of real-time games, or at the leisure of the player in turn-based games. The loop halts when the player wins, loses, or quits the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example we will see for a while-loop is one that emulates a for-loop. In this case, a certain counter is started, and that counter is incremented each time the looping block is executed. When the counter reaches a certain point, the loop stops.\n"

    "## The fizzbuzz challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic programming exercise, appearing in many courses and even job interviews. The task is simple, but if you can solve it, you know you've got the hang of logic and flow control. Your task is to write a short program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100, but if the number is divisible by 3, to print \"Fizz\" instead; and if it is divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\"; and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"Fizzbuzz\". Everything you need to solve this challenge is contained in the above text, but you will need to design an algorithm that successfully combines these elements to produce the correct solution.\n",
