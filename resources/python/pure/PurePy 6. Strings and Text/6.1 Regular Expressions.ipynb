All I can hope to do is give you some examples and appreciation for them and how you would go about starting to use them. So here's the low-down. The feature is available in some form in pretty much every programming language, text editor, and command-line shell to search text for specific patterns. A regular expression is essentially a string that describes a pattern with some fairly complex syntax, and then other strings can be checked to see if they match this pattern.

    "#### Greedy vs non-greedy repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how ```+``` and ```*``` could be used to repeat a character an arbitrary number of times. However, there are two possible behaviours for this repetition operator: \"greedy\", and \"non-greedy\". The greedy version is the default: it will keep matching characters until the condition fails, for example, ```\\S``` will keep matching non-space characters until the next character is a space. The non-greedy option is specified by adding ```?```: the non-greedy option will keep matching until the next part of the pattern succeeeds. In other words ```\\S+?o``` will match all non-space characters up to the next ```o``` character. For example, ```\\S+?\\.com``` could be used to extract ```.com``` web addresses, but  ```\\S+\\.com``` won't, because .com <i>is</i> a non-space character and will be considered part of the ```\\S+``` part of the string: this part \"eats up\" <i>everything</i> until the next space."

Some considerations: \"cat\" is a very short word, appearing inside many other words, and it may appear in plural or possessive form, eg \"cats\" or \"cat's\", and it may begin a sentence and hence be capitalized.
