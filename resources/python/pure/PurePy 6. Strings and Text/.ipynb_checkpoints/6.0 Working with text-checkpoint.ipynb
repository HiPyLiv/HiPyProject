    "Working with strings is an important skill in Python. For one, reading data into a program will often take the form of a file containing text, and so we must be proficient in extracting the bits we're interested in. Moreover, we are humans. We do not want the computer to merely spit out a list of numbers after performing a calculation; we want our outputs presented in a way that we can actually read.\n",

    "# Text\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be looking at the title of this section and thinking \"wait, haven't we just learned all about text?\". And the answer is yes... sort of. We've been learning about how to work with text inside Python. We've just been willy-nilly writing some strings and slicing them up. What we have not talked about, and is unfortunately an important thing to be aware of, is text that is out there in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The bad news\n",
    "\n",
    "Some terminology first. A <i>character</i> is the abstract meaning behind the little squiggles you see on the screen that form text. The squiggles themselves are called \"glyphs\". However, the glyphs cannot be the characters, since in different fonts, the same character can be represented by two very different glyphs. So for instance, the character that is \"the first uppercase letter of the latin alphabet and sounds like 'ey'\" is represented by the glyph \"A\". We don't need to worry about glyphs, since this is determined by the font of our computer, not our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with text in Python, we just see the strings as \"a sequence of characters\". This is great, and is exactly how you <i>should</i> think of strings when you manipulate them in Python. Trouble is, computers do not store characters; they store numbers written in binary. This means there is a natural problem of deciding which characters correspond to which numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably you've not encountered this problem in any meaningful way before. You may have stumbled across webpages with some missing or incorrect characters. But in your life, you've mostly been working with word processed documents, in a familiar word processor, written using characters native to your language. Or you've been using webpages via web-browsers built by people who understand this problem and have essentially solved it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the days of yore, computer users mostly just shared software around their own universities and workplaces, at the very least within their own country. This means that lots of different <i>character encodings</i> sprang up -- methods for turning the bytes (numbers) in a file into text on the screen. In the UK and US, the common solution was ASCII encoding, which due to our relatively small alphabet meant that each character could be stored in a single byte as a number between 0 and 127.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, there is something called the internet, which means that text is now flying all over the world, from the US, which uses only a few characters; to Europe, which uses more because of all the accents; to Greece, Russia, and Middle East, which have different alphabets; to China, which has literally thousands of characters. Also, in the 21st century, there are emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you're planning on interacting with text that comes from a source outside of your own computer, you might run into problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is a system for organizing the characters of the world, as well as a set of standards for encoding these characters. In a nutshell, each character is assigned to a unicode \"code point\", usually written in . For instance the letter \"A\" is \"0041\". This is <b>not</b> an encoding, but merely an organization method. At least now we can organize the characters of the world into some kind of coherent structure, a bit like a periodic table of elements but for text.  According to Wikipedia, the current version of unicode contains 136,755 characters from 139 writing systems, plus additional symbols that are not from any particular writing system, such as emoji. When you create a string in Python, it is considered to be a sequence of unicode code points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unicode code points are generally given in hexadecimal. This is simply a way of writing down numbers using 16 symbols instead of the usual ten (or two, in binary), meaning larger numbers can be written using fewer digits. Since we have only ten numerals, letters are used instead; the numerals used in hexadecimal are 0123456789ABCDEF. E is fourteen, F is fifteen. 10 is sixteen, 11 is seventeen, all the way to FF, which is 255 in decimal, and then we start again with 100. This is just a way to shorten long numbers in binary -- each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary digits (bits), meaning that a byte is represented by two hex digits. There's rarely any need to do arithmetic with hex-reperesented numbers, or figure out what the decimal/binary representation is. Just be aware that when you see, say, \"A3\" when discussing a unicode code point, it is actually a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There remains the question then of how to encode these characters into bytes. Unicode has several possible standards. The reason for different standards is that European computer users, say, whose languages' characters could be stored in 2 bytes, did not want to have to use additional bytes to store all the Chinese characters they seldom used, for example by allocating 4 bytes per character. By having different encoding systems, we've solved one problem, but it's very not flexible. What about times when we need those occasional Chinese characters? What about emoji?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then two bright sparks, Ken Thompson and Rob Pike, came up with a new encoding system called UTF-8. In their system the number of bytes per character could vary. The standard ASCII characters, for example, could be stored as 1 byte. Accented characters, 2 bytes. 3 bytes is enough to store all the Chinese characters. Other, uncommon symbols, such as emoji, are relegated to taking up 4 bytes. And all of these can co-exist within the same file. There's no need to switch encoding midway through. In theory, it \"just works\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a price to pay, as with most nice things in life. For a program to search through UTF-8 encoded text now takes longer, because it can't count on each of the characters being the same length (in terms of digits); it has to check each byte separately to see when one character ends and the next begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, UTF-8 is now the standard encoding on the web, accounting for 90% of websites. The Python interpreter expects Python files to be written in UTF-8. Python \"just works\" when it reads UTF-8 encoded text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The good news\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with these different encodings in Python is actually fairly straightforward for the most part. Your mission when working with text in Python should be to convert it to a string as soon as is possible. In string form, you are working directly with <i>characters</i> -- that is to say, unicode code points, and don't have to worry about what these characters are actually stored as in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two functions you need are <code>str.encode()</code> and <code>bytes.decode()</code> (where <code>str</code> and <code>bytes</code> are the snippet you want to en-/decode. The argument taken is the name of the encoding to be used, given as a string -- the default encoding is UTF-8."

There is some good news here, actually: the most commonly used characters in English form part of the ASCII character set, which if we recall stores each character as a number between 0 and 127. One of the clever aspects of UTF-8 encoding is that the encodings for these particular characters are identical to their ASCII encodings. You can open a file written in ASCII using an UTF-8 decoding algorithm and you wouldn't know the difference.\n",

Other than that, you may have to use some trial and error.
