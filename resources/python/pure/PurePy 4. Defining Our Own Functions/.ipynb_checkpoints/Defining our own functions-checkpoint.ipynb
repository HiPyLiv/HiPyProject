    "# Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that there are many useful functions built-in to Python, and many more available sitting in the standard library and other modules just waiting to be imported to help us complete tasks. This is far from the end of the story though. We previous defined a function to be a command that takes an input argument, and returns an output. The real power of functions, however, is that we can create our own, making a piece of code that can be reused anywhere in our program, or imported into other programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the key to programming is breaking down large complex tasks into small simple tasks. Functions are the key to doing this. They help us to organize and formalize this process by turning each small task into a separate function. These functions can then be reused and combined over and over. For this reason, you should virtually never have to copy and paste code to complete several similar tasks: the correct thing to do is create a function that completes these tasks, and use it several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the concept computer scientists refer to as \"abstraction\". It means that already-solved problems can be essentially forgotten about, treated as single step in an algorithm, however complex that problem may have been initially. For example, if I am building a program that collects stock market data from the web, the simple act of making a webpage request is extraordinarily complex. My request travels in the form of electrical \"on/off\" (0/1) signals through the air to my home router, a computer which reads the metadata of my request and sends the request on a journey via dozens of other routers; to a server with the software to decode my 0s and 1s; which then gets the stock market data by some other magic; and then sends the data back to my computer's address, again via dozens of routers, each one figuring where to send the information next; finally decoded my home computer. The process is extremely complex. But it was solved by the original engineers of the internet and the hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) decades ago. To me, in my project, I just run <code>pandas</code>' web data reader function. It's all achieved in a single step. That is abstraction in a nutshell. Functions allow us to solve a complicated problem once, and then treat it as a single step thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, functions in the code are indicated by a header, followed by the correct indentation. The keyword for the header is <code>def</code>, for \"define\". The function then executes until it reaches the end of the indented text or, more importantly, until it reaches the <code>return</code> keyword, which tells the function what to output."

    "As your programs get bigger, and especially if you collaborate with others on your program, making it clear what functions do becomes a bigger and bigger problem. Once you have written a function, you, or your collaborators will not necessarily want to have to read the code to remember how to use it. Mostly, they'll just want to know what inputs to give it, and what output to expect -- the computational details may be no longer relevant. For this purpose, we use a doc-string. A doc-string is a short \"help\" paragraph written just below the function's header, delimited by three quote marks. Let's give <code>is_even()</code> a doc-string. There are no hard rules, so long as it is clear."
