    "Now then, multplication. Actually, I'm not so happy with the multiplication algorithm here. It's very ugly, and in no way easy to understand. I'll explain it briefly, but I also encourage you to have a go at doing a better job than me. The algorithm is based on the fact that the coefficient of the $k$th term in a polynomial that is the product of two polynomials is the sum of products of coefficients in the multiplicands whose indices sum to $k$. So I use a generator to generator pairs of numbers that sum to $k$, and then multiply the corresponding terms using a nested list comprehension. Mathematically, if polynomials with coefficients $b_i$s and $c_j$s are multiplied, then\n",

Usually this will work anyway because the <code>something</code> will itself be a polynomial, and so Python will use <code>something</code>'s addition method. But we have also allowed <code>something</code> to be a number, which doesn't no what to do if it meets our polynomial object. Thankfully this is easily fixed.
