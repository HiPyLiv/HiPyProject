    "# Introduction to object oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is one of Python's most powerful features, but also one that requires a large conceptual leap for beginners. The benefits of OOP are that the components of your program -- the data, and functions -- can be structured into \"objects\" that interact with each other, in an analogy to the way that the real world is also made of interacting objects. This provides an intuitive way to organize large programming projects and complex data structures. Moreover, OOP is at the core of how the Python language is structured. Even if you don't end up making your own objects and classes very often in your code, your understanding of how Python really works, as well as how most of the imported modules you are used to using really work, will be vastly expanded once these concepts are understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will gradually build the intuition behind OOP before getting into the nitty-gritty -- jumping straight into examples will lead to confusion.\n",

    "Until now, you have probably thought of \"string\" or \"list\" as being a \"type\". This is, not wrong, of course. But we need a new piece of terminology to move in to object-oriented thinking. \"String\" should now be thought of as a <i>class</i>. A class is the abstract blueprint for an object. The class <code>'str'</code> defines everything that a string can do. What data can a string contain? What functions does it know? How should it interact with other objects? What happens if you write <code>\"A string\"[4]</code>? The abstract class of strings contains the blueprints for every string we create.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deal with object-oriented programming is that we get to design our own classes, containing exactly the kind of data we want, with exactly the kind of behaviours we want. Then, our program can create objects using our class definition, called <i>instances</i> of the class, just like we have this general class of strings, and then create instances of strings every time we write <code>\"A string\"</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vivid example might be the bad guys in a computer game. If the game is written using object-oriented programming, there will be in the code some class defining what is the bad guy -- this will be data such as what he looks like on the screen, his health, any weapons he is carrying (which will be objects in themselves!), and so on. Then he will have functions controlling his AI, what happens when his health reaches 0, and such. Then, the game will create multiple <i>instances</i> of this baddie to chase after the player, all of which contain their own collection of this rich information and behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rich complexity of many objects from modules you might have already met in Sam Ball's Python, Data, and You tutorials such as <code>numpy</code>'s arrays and <code>pandas</code>' frames are due to those modules containing well-designed array and data frame classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A final word of motivation. The concepts of object-oriented programming are significantly more abstract than anything up to this point. Do not be discouraged if it takes a while to 'click'.\n",

    "<b>Comparisons with other OOP languages</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many object-oriented programming languages such as Java have a concept of private and public methods and attributes. The idea is that a private method or attribute can only be accessed from within the object itself -- another method of that same object has to call it. In contrast, a public method can be called by any other part of the program . The idea is to provide some degree of safety and security -- preventing important variables from being changed willy-nilly, for instance. This is especially relevant in collaborative projects when allowing one person working on one part of the program to change important variables in another part of the program could have disasterous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we do not have this concept -- the language is designed not to throw up these kinds of artificial barriers (whether this is a good thing is down to personal taste). However, Python programmers have their own solution -- if a method or attribute is supposed to be private, an underscore is added to the beginning such as <code>_mymethod</code>. This doesn't actually do anything, it's just a warning to anyone else working with the code -- fiddle with this at your own risk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common safety feature is the idea of \"getters\" and \"setters\". These are methods which control access to private attributes. For instance, I may have some attributes that I do not want to be changed except in a specific, safe way. Therefore, I make the attribute private, but then create a \"setter\" method, which provides a safe interface for modifying that attribute (for instance, checking that it is being changed to a sensible value). Again, while there's nothing stopping you from defining setters, Python doesn't really have the concept of private attributes. Therefore, setter methods are not usually necessary."
