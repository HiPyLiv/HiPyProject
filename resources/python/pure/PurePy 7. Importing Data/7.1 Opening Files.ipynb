    "# Opening files\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're writing a program, it's pretty clear that we don't want to always have to type the data we're working with directly into the source code. Rather, we want to get the data from an external source: either the web, or a file on our computer. In this article, we're going to look at how to work with files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you read the article about string manipulation, and in particular, the bit about character encodings? It might be helpful here!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The <code>open()</code> function and its modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has one built-in function for getting the information out of a file, or writing information to a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is simply the <code>open()</code> function. Its first argument is always a string, which is the path to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you checked out the lesson on using the command line (and if you haven't you really should!), the way that file paths work should be very familiar. They can be either relative or absolute. Relative to what? Well, Python has a current working directory, just like you do when you are working via the command line. This will default to the current working directory you were in when you ran Python. Finally, in Python you should always use forward slashes in file paths, even if your computer uses backslashes. The <code>open()</code> function is smart and will figure this out for you -- it means the same code can easily open files on different operating systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens next is dependent on the next argument: the mode. This will determine whether the file should be opened as text or as bytes, and whether you want to read the file or write to the file. We'll deal with these modes now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a file object, which you should store as a variable to refer to later (otherwise the file will be opened but you won't be able to access it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read mode, 'r'\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the mode you need to get the data out of a file as text; it is the default mode when opening. By default, it attempts to decode the file using the default encoding of your computer. For instance, a Windows computer and a Linux machine may have different default encodings. To be safe, it's best to specify the correct encoding by passing the keyword argument <code>encoding</code>. \n",
    "\n",
